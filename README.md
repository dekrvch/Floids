# Floids
Self-organization in a Multi-Agent System (Boids and Fireflies)

https://dekrvch.github.io/Floids/

This 3D simulation features agents (floids) combining Boids and Firefly algorithms. They flock and synchronize their flashing. The project is based on the Three.js library. To find couples of neighbors, a Grid search algorithm is implememnted to reduce the computation costs.
