Who is the conductor of the forest light orchestra, and how do thousands of bugs choose the leader to follow? In 1992 a group of scientists discovered that there is no mastermind behind the scene. Each firefly flashes <i>cyclically</i> according to its internal clock. Every time a firefly sees its neighbors flashing, it slightly <i>nudges</i> its clock, decreasing the time difference. These slight tweaks, by individuals over time, lead to full synchronization. Mathematically this behavior can be described as the synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators.<br><img src="http://172.26.48.1:8082/firing.svg" width="80%"><br>When experimenting with the algorithm implementation, I observed the best results when the fireflies nudge their clock proportionally to the sine of the phase difference with the just fired neighbors. This way, the synchronization is initially quick but slows down as the phase differences become small. You can adjust the <i>cycle duration</i>, <i>nudging coefficient</i>, and the <i>graphics shader parameters</i> in the <i>Firing</i> control menu.</p><h3>Flocking</h3><h3>Hunter</h3><h3>Grid</h3><h3>References</h3></div></body></html>
